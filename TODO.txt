TODO List
==========

* Add ability to swap network protocol -- would need TCP to use this for my
  use-case.

* Explore NAT traversal options.

* seems like qcReceiver::processDatagram() receives byte packets of arbitrary
  sizes, while opus needs packet sizes to match exactly what was obtained after
  encode(), so we need to add our own mashalling information to indentify
  packets.
